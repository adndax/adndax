## 👋 Hi there, I'm Dinda!

I’m an undergraduate student in Informatics Engineering at Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). My main focus is on building clean, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces using ReactJS and modern web technologies.

I’m also currently exploring Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, aiming to combine my skills in front-end development with intelligent systems and data-driven solutions.

Beyond coding, I’m interested in UI/UX design, believing that great design and great functionality should always go hand in hand.

> Always learning, always building. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀
