## 👋 Hi there, I'm Dinda!

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Informatics Engineering** at **Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB)**, currently diving deep into **front-end development**. I love crafting clean, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces 💻🎨

Right now, I'm focusing on **ReactJS** and modern web technologies, always exploring new tools and techniques to bring creative ideas to life. I'm also passionate about contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers in the community 🌱

Besides coding, I also enjoy designing thoughtful UI/UX experiences that are both beautiful and user-centric. I believe that great design is just as important as great functionality ✨

> Always learning, always building. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀
